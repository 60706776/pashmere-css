            </div>
            <div class="right">
                <p>The story of our family is long history begins in the early 1800s, a period in which the Galatioto
                    Rosso
                    Family, Sicilian barons with ancient roots, had a fleet of ships in the port of Catania, which
                    carried
                    Sicilian citrus fruit, fabrics from England and precious silks and purple dyes from the Middle East.
                    The
                    goods travelled through the Mediterranean, including Spain, Greece, Italy and North Africa and in
                    Northern Europe between England, Holland, Germany and Russia</p>
                <p>In 1917, Baron Francesco Galatioto found himself in Moscow, Russia, at the very moment when the
                    Russian
                    Revolution took place. He daringly fought his way back to Sicily. After a very long journey, when he
                    touched the ground he knelt down, overjoyed and kissed it. Over the years the family grew a passion
                    for
                    textiles and clothing, and eventually stopped working in the field of naval transport around 1930s.
                    They
                    moved to Milan to devote themselves to the production of lingerie and opened a small manual weaving
                    laboratory. The business stopped due to the outbreak of World War II and Carmelo Galatioto (son of
                    Baron
                    Francesco) went off to war</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="orta">
            <div class="left1">
                <p>In 1946 after returning to Milan unharmed, he decided to take over the lingerie business with the
                    rest of
                    his sizeable family. In 1947, the company was founded in Milan and in response to the great demand
                    for
                    lingerie, the company grew very quickly and supplied the most important department stores in Europe;
                    by
                    the mid-50s, it had more than 1,000 employees and hundreds of industrial machines</p>
                <p>Around 1960, Carmelo Galatioto, who was in charge of commerce, had many requests from customers for
                    knitted garments. Thus, with his wife Mariuccia, he opened a small knitwear workshop in Milan in
                    what
                    was at that time a suburban area of the city: Corso Como No. 10. Nowadays it is the center of
                    Milanese
                    nightlife and fashion, and the site of a famous clothing store</p>
                <p>The global knitwear market began to grow, and customers increasingly demanded knitwear in the style
                    of
                    Luisa Spagnoli, a Perugia based brand.Hence Carmelo and Mariuccia decided to leave the family
                    business and start production in the green heart of Italy: Umbria a land renowned for tradition and
                    high quality knitwear</p>

        <div class="past">
            <p>The distance between Milan and Umbria proved to be quite considerable, so in 1965 they decided to move
                permanently to Perugia with their son Francesco and it was then that the Maglificio GALASSIA S.R.L. was
                founded</p>
            <p>Since its early years, the company has distinguished itself in the high quality of its knitwear and
                accessories for the growing international market. Their style and quality did not go unnoticed, which is
                how the Galassia company started important partnerships with high fashion brands, producing and
                distributing knitwear, even on exclusive license, for Trussardi, Gian Marco Venturi, Gianfranco Ferre
                and many more</p>
            <p>Over the years the company grew and in the 80’s the management passed to the second generation: Francesco
                and his wife, designer and product manager Laura Galatioto. Productions for major brands continued and
                during the 90’s important contracts were signed with Nazareno Gabrielli, Fendi, t.s Dupont, Dunhill.</p>
            <p>Laura personally joined forces with Gianni Versace on license to create a vanguard knitwear style to be
                distributed worldwide. In 2000, as a result of the experience gained over the years, the management
                decided to focus their business efforts on a property trademark with exclusive traits: PASHMERE. In 2015
                the company, now in its third generation with Gabriele and Emanuele Galatioto, has celebrated its 50th
                year anniversary</p>
